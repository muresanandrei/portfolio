## About

> Iâ€™m a senior software engineer currently leading the web team at softhaus, a distributed team of freelancers from Europe and the US.

With over 7 years of experience, I specialize in web and app development using PHP (Laravel), Node.js, GO, or newer technologies such as React or Gatsby. In my free time, I have developed & maintained React Native apps, complex web apps, Linux servers and scalable API's.
